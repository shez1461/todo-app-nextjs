# Tech Test

Front-End Tech Test

# Introduction

The test is aimed at testing yours skills at setting up and creating a TODO tasks application with 
ReactJS using the [next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) Framework.

The application should create, modify and delete tasks.

The tasks should also be persisted so that the tasks survive a page refresh.

We expect the application to be unit tested.

The UI must be responsive, accessible and pretty.

Please include instructions on how we can build and run the code.

# Process

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) project.
Once you are happy with your code please provide us with a link to the repository.
We will review the application and get back to you.

Have fun!
